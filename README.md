## ðŸŒŸ Features
- **Multi-Model Approach**: Implements multiple algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and a Neural Network model with TensorFlow, to identify the best-performing model.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves over 80% accuracy through rigorous preprocessing, feature selection, and tuning.
- **Comprehensive Data Analysis**: Utilizes exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization to provide insights into patterns associated with heart disease.

## Project Overview
The Heart Disease Prediction Model is built to analyze patient health data and predict heart disease risk. It uses a dataset of medical features, such as age, gender, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels, with the goal of aiding healthcare providers in identifying high-risk patients.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: The primary programming language, using libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras.
- **Data Visualization**: Seaborn and Matplotlib are used for visual analysis of the dataset.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Various algorithms including KNN, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks.

## Data Preprocessing
- **One-Hot Encoding**: Categorical variables are encoded to be machine-readable.
- **Scaling**: Features are scaled to improve model performance.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: In-depth EDA to uncover trends and correlations within the dataset.
