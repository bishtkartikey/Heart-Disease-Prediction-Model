<h1 style="font-size: 50px;">Heart Disease Prediction Model</h1>

## 1. Introduction
The Heart Disease Prediction Model is a machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on various health indicators. Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, making early detection crucial for preventive care. By analyzing patient data, this model aims to help healthcare providers identify high-risk patients, ultimately improving healthcare outcomes.

It is also important that a doctor be present so that they could treat them. To make things worse, the tests usually take a long time before diagnosing whether a person would suffer from heart disease. However, it would be handy and better if we automate this process which ensures that we save a lot of time and effort on the part of the doctor and patient.

## 2. Machine Learning and Data Science
Machine learning and data science techniques are applied in this project to build predictive models from medical data. We explore different machine learning algorithms and data science practices, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation, to create a model capable of accurate heart disease risk prediction. The project uses Python, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow, along with libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib for data handling and visualization.

## 3. Data
The dataset used for this project contains various medical features such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other health-related metrics. Each record represents a patient, with columns detailing their health metrics and a target variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease. Key steps in data processing include:
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Scaling numerical features

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA helps uncover patterns and insights within the data, facilitating better feature selection and model building. EDA in this project includes:
- Statistical summary of data
- Distribution analysis of key health metrics
- Analysis of correlations between features and the target variable
- Identifying outliers and anomalies

This step lays the foundation for informed data preprocessing and model selection.

## 5. Visualizations
In this section, we will be visualizing some interests plots and trends in the data which is used by machine learning models to make predictions. We will also evaluate the performance of different machine learning and deep learning models on a given dataset by comparing various metrics. To identify the best version of each model, we will examine their hyperparameters.

To begin, we will review the list of rows and columns (features) in our dataset, which includes age, sex, cp (chest pain), chol, and others. This will provide insight into the types of features present and help us determine if additional features are necessary for analysis.

Next, we will review the dataset for completeness by examining non-null values across each feature. With 303 entries, we confirm the dataset includes information on 1025 patients. Memory usage is minimal, so additional memory optimization steps, such as downcasting, are not needed.

The heatmap provides a visual representation of the correlation between various features in the dataset, making it easy to identify relationships and patterns among the variables. Each cell in the heatmap corresponds to the correlation coefficient between two features, with values ranging from -1 to 1. A value of 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation, while -1 signifies a perfect negative correlation, and a value of 0 indicates no correlation. In the heatmap, the color intensity signifies the strength of these correlations: lighter colors suggest stronger relationships. For instance, features such as 'thalach' (maximum heart rate achieved) and 'slope' (slope of the peak exercise ST segment) may exhibit a positive correlation, implying that as one feature increases, the other tends to increase as well. Conversely, negative correlations, such as those between 'slope' and 'oldpeak', suggest that as one feature increases, the other decreases. This visualization aids in identifying which features may influence heart disease outcomes and can guide further analysis in predictive modeling and feature selection.

Each entry in the array corresponds to a subplot that is configured to display a specific feature of the dataset, allowing for a comprehensive visual analysis of multiple variables simultaneously. The titles indicate the features being plotted, including 'age,' 'sex,' 'cp' (chest pain type), 'trestbps' (resting blood pressure), 'chol' (cholesterol level), 'fbs' (fasting blood sugar), 'restecg' (resting electrocardiographic results), 'thalach' (maximum heart rate achieved), 'exang' (exercise induced angina), 'oldpeak' (depression induced by exercise relative to rest), 'slope' (slope of the peak exercise ST segment), 'ca' (number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy), 'thal' (thalassemia), and 'target' (presence or absence of heart disease). This arrangement of subplots facilitates a detailed examination of the relationships and distributions among these variables, enabling researchers to identify patterns, trends, and potential correlations that may influence heart disease outcomes.

This plot effectively illustrates the distribution of patients with heart disease compared to those without, highlighting a significant prevalence of heart disease among the sample. The larger number of patients diagnosed with heart disease not only emphasizes the importance of addressing this health issue but also provides a robust dataset for developing predictive classifiers. The balanced class distribution indicates that the dataset is well-structured, allowing for reliable evaluations of machine learning models using metrics such as accuracy. This balance is crucial as it ensures that the model is trained on a diverse set of examples, reducing the risk of bias and improving its generalization capabilities. Overall, this visualization underscores the dataset's potential to inform meaningful insights and contribute to the advancement of heart disease diagnostics and treatment strategies.

The box plot displayed above provides a visual summary of the distribution of features within the heart disease dataset. Each box represents the interquartile range (IQR), which encapsulates the middle 50% of the data points, with the line inside each box indicating the median value. The whiskers extend to represent the range of the data, while any points outside this range are considered outliers. This visualization enables us to quickly assess the central tendency, variability, and potential outliers for each feature associated with heart disease. By analyzing the box plots, we can identify features with significant variability, which may warrant further investigation during the data preprocessing stage. Additionally, the clear representation of outliers provides insights into individual patient data that may differ substantially from the rest of the population, potentially influencing model performance in predicting heart disease outcomes. Overall, the box plot serves as an essential tool for understanding the characteristics of the dataset, guiding subsequent analyses and modeling efforts.
